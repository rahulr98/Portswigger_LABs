### Solution

  -  Consider a shopping application that displays an image filename.
  -  Next, we must change the application's filename using Burp Suite.
  -  We give the filename as a combination of '....' and '//'. So, if the application strips '..' or '/' additional '..' and '/' are available which gives the result.
