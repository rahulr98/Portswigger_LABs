### Solution

  -  The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response.
  -  Now we edit the email section in the feedback section However, we can use output redirection to capture the output from the command.
  -  Now, if we give a ping command it gets a 10 seconds delay to respond which clarifies that the command we give is working.
